  Instructions:
  - "Welcome to Killary's Kill em all. This demonstrates shows how to play the game.
    \n"
  - Behind you is the Capitol Building. You have to defend it from onrushing Trump
    Supporters
  - "Use WASD keys on your keyboard to move. Use space to Jump. \nPick up the weapons
    in front on you using the F key."
  - Shoot as many Trump supporters as you can. Kill the boss monsters within the
    time limit.
  - Check for Boss positions in the map using M.
  - Keep an eye on the Fire gauge in the bottom right of your screen. Once its full
    use Tab to use "Reptilian Fire attack" and burn multiple supporters at once.
  - Lastly, if you have a weak heart, this can be a rough place. Goodluck on your
    game!
  - A new boss is causing havok. Navigate using the map with M and kill him before
    the time runs out.
